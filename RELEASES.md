# ParVu Releases

## Downloads

| Platform | File | Size |
|---|---|---|
| Linux (Ubuntu/Debian, 64-bit) | `parvu_X.Y.Z_amd64.deb` | about 30 MB |
| Windows 10/11 (64-bit) | `parvu_X.Y.Z_x64-setup.exe` | about 15 MB |

## Linux

```bash
sudo apt install ./parvu_X.Y.Z_amd64.deb
parvu
```

`apt` installs the two system libraries ParVu needs (WebKitGTK and GTK) if they are missing. `sudo dpkg -i` also works when they are already installed.

The package replaces any earlier ParVu `.deb`, including the Python versions (0.x). Settings, recent files and themes in `~/.ParVu` are kept.

Uninstall with `sudo apt remove parvu`.

### Beta builds

Beta packages are named `parvu-next` and install next to `parvu`, so you can try a new version without removing the current one. Start the beta with `parvu-next`. Both share `~/.ParVu`.

## Windows

Run `parvu_X.Y.Z_x64-setup.exe` and follow the wizard. It adds a Start menu entry and registers ParVu for Parquet, CSV, JSON and Excel files. Uninstall from **Settings → Apps**.

ParVu uses Microsoft Edge WebView2, which is part of Windows 10 and 11. If it is missing, the installer downloads it.

## Troubleshooting

**Linux: the window is blank or the app does not start.** Run `parvu` from a terminal to see errors. On some graphics drivers this helps:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 parvu
```

**Windows: "Windows protected your PC".** The installer is not code-signed yet. Click **More info → Run anyway**.

**Logs** are in `~/.ParVu/logs/` on both platforms (`%USERPROFILE%\.ParVu\logs` on Windows). See [docs/CRASH_REPORTING.md](docs/CRASH_REPORTING.md).

## Verifying downloads

```bash
sha256sum parvu_*.deb
```

```powershell
Get-FileHash parvu_*.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

Compare with the checksum in the release notes.

## Building a release

See [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md). Pushing a `v*` tag makes CI build both installers and attach them to the run.
